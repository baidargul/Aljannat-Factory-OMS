This project involves the development of a comprehensive solution for a local bakery production facility. Currently managing their operations through Excel files, the client has enlisted my services to implement a more efficient system.

The proposed solution encompasses a Point of Sale (POS) system designed to input orders originating from various channels such as Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, and their primary website. Subsequently, each order undergoes a hierarchical processing workflow, involving different users, until it is forwarded to the inventory management team. Logistic companies are then engaged to compile and transport the orders to customers.

Additionally, the application integrates with logistics APIs to track the orders throughout the transportation process. Furthermore, it facilitates the monitoring of payment receipts, providing a comprehensive solution that streamlines the bakery's operations.
